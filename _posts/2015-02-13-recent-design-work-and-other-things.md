title: Recent Design Work (And Other Things)
---

Clearly I have not been keeping my goal of weekly blog posts, but that's ok. I'm keeping busy. I've done a little bit of design work in the past couple of weeks that turned out very nicely. I just want to take a minute and show them off to the world, especially since most of my creative work never sees the light of day.

This is for an event my college cycling club is putting on.

I redid my resume in preparation for spring career fair and the rest of my summer job search. I haven't gotten much feedback yet, but I like it a lot more than the old one!

![A beer label](http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2015-02-13/img03.png)

My housemate has a carboy of homebrew beer sitting in our basement ready to be bottled. I decided to make a label for him, because I've always wanted to make a beer label. Apparently it was supposed to be a stout but isn't dark enough. I went with black and white because hey, black and white printing is free on the school printers.

I also just started a show on WMTU 91.9 FM Houghton, the college radio station. It's Wednesdays from 8-10am Eastern and is tons of fun! You can also listen on <a href="http://wmtu.mtu.edu" target="_blank">wmtu.mtu.edu</a>.

I'm participating in my first XC ski race tomorrow and it's accross a bay of Lake Superior. The temperature is supposed to be around 0F and I haven't skiied in a year or two. We'll see how that goes.
