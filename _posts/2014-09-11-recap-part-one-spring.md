title: Recap Part One:&nbsp;Spring
---

*I've neglected this blog for a few months now, and it seems a shame to ignore everything that's happened in the mean time. This is the first part in a two-part series playing catch-up.*

In early April, I jumped on the opportunity to make a weekend trip south to Ripon, Wisconsin with some of my <a href="http://www.cycling.mtu.edu" target="_blank">cycling clubmates</a> to race road bikes and get away from the snow.

It great to relax for a weekend and catch some sunshine. I somehow managed to come in 3rd in the D's (newbies) criterium, despite being the only person on a steel road bike with downtube shifters.

A week or two later, a full lunar eclipse was predicted in the wee hours of the morning. My friend Bryan and I jumped at the chance and lucked out with a quick break in the clouds aligning perfectly with the event.

I finally managed to get out to the family cabin, despite the wet snow and my lack of snowshoes. Next year I plan to take advantage of it much more. It was in surprisingly good shape, but will need some sweeping and scrubbing inside. It's a perfect bike ride in the fall, assuming the weather holds.

My friend Helen convinced me to get involved in some <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mtuovc" target="_blank">OVC</a> outings. A combination of rad people, adventure, and the natural wonders of the <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yooper" target="_blank">yoop</a> coincided in the best way possible. No adventure is complete without the possibility of arrest by federal agents or death by icefall. As always, I wish I had gotten involved sooner.

*Stay tuned for part two.*
