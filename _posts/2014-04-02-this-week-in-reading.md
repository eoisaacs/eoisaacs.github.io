As spring continues to deny its presence in the UP, I've decided to look for more quality reading material on the internet. There is a lot out there, and it's a lot more satisfying and fullfilling than the "fast-foods" of online mediaâ€”Reddit, Buzzfeed, Twitter, and Facebook. I've found enough good content that I'm going to start putting together collections so that other people can enjoy it as well.

Here's what I've been digging recently:

###BBC

####<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26855657" target="_blank">US Supreme Court strikes down overall donor limits</a>

I don't know if this is good news for freedom of expression, or basically the legalization of unlimited bribes. Campaign funding is a really grey area for me. I think political freedom is extremely important, but elections should be won through merit rather than based on who can be bought most easily.

####<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26254706" target="_blank>Viewpoint: Escape from the 'sink' estate"</a>

An interesting counterpoint to the idea that people are poor because they're lazy and irresponsible.

####<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26669971" target="_blank">American Dream breeds shame and blame for job seekers</a>

If you can't get a job, that might not be your fault, but that's not what American ideals tell us.

####<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26838177" target="_blank">How the secret police tracked my childhood</a>

A fascinating and surreal insight into living in a totalitarian political system.

###Al Jazeera America

####<a href="Debunking the pathology of poverty](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/3/culture-of-povertysocialwelfarepaulryanaffluenza.html</a>

Another argument against the "tough love" approach to solving poverty.

####<a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/features/2014/3/as-coal-fades-inwestvirginiadrugsfillthevoid.html" target= "_blank">As coal fades in West Virginia, drugs fill void</a>

I think the question of what happens to people when the industry they rely on dies out is going to become even more important in the near future.

###Adventure Journal

I can't get enough of this website, especially the essays. They're all fantastic.

####<a href="http://www.adventure-journal.com/2011/11/national-parks-head-blocked-grand-canyon-bottle-ban-after-meeting-with-coca-cola/" target="_blank">National Parks Head Blocked Grand Canyon Bottle Ban After Meeting with Coca-Cola</a>

This is old, but still. Sellouts.

####<a href="http://www.adventure-journal.com/2012/04/a-conversation-with-an-environmentalist-oil-industry-worker/" target= "_blank">A Conversation With an Environmentalist Oil Industry Worker</a>

I don't think I could do it. There is too much moral conflict in supporting an industry as environmentally destructive as the petroleum industry.

####<a href="http://www.adventure-journal.com/2009/12/the-joys-of-chopping-firewood/" target= "_blank">An Adventure Life Essay: The Joys of Chopping Firewood</a>

Chop some firewood. It's good for you.

####<a href="http://www.adventure-journal.com/2011/05/the-contrails-of-the-western-sky/" target= "_blank">The Contrails of the Western Sky</a>

Great essay on perspectives.

####<a href="http://www.adventure-journal.com/2014/03/happiness-is-in-the-little-things/" target= "_blank">Happiness Is in the Little Things</a>

Enjoy where you are and the fun things you can do on a daily basis. It sounds cliche, but they actually make you happier than big trips/occasions.

####<a href="http://www.adventure-journal.com/2014/03/the-partner-gap-and-the-risks-of-unsolicited-advice/" target= "_blank">The Partner Gap and the Risks of Unsolicited Advice</a>

Discussion of relationships between people of differing abilities.

### In Focus - The Atlantic

####<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/04/a-trip-to-lesotho-the-kingdom-of-the-sky/100708/" target= "_blank">A Trip to Lesotho, the 'Kingdom of the Sky'</a>

Not exactly heavy on reading, but I had no idea Lesotho was this beautiful. This photography blog is very much worth following.

###Pinkbike

####<a href="http://www.pinkbike.com/news/east-bound-and-down-brevard-calling-2014.html" target= "_blank">East Bound and Down: Brevard Calling</a>

I can't wait to get back on my mountain bike this spring, even if I won't be riding in North Carolina.
