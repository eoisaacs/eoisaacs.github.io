title: Flown and Gone
---

After many bittersweet goodbyes to friends and favorite places, I'm finally on my way to Michigan. My friends, Bury the Moon, wrote a great song about this moment. They probably don't appreciate me posting this old, impromptu recording but that's really too bad for them since they have yet to release a newer one.

I'm a little nervous but mostly excited to explore and meet new people. I will be very busy for the next few weeks so I'm not sure when my next post will be. It may be brief.
