After a late-night video planning session, some guys from the cycling club invited me to go snowshoeing in Copper Harbor the next day. We took advantage of our free first time rentals from the outdoor adventure program. Quite a few poeple were waiting for snowshoes when we got there.

The snow was practically untouched. We managed to stay on top most of the time, but there were spots where it was easy to sink in to the waist. We saw some faint downhill ski tracks, but no other signs of people. It was pretty different seeing the trail in the winter compared to biking it in the summer.

Like with every good adventure, tree climbing was in order. Snowshoing can be surprisingly exciting if you do it right. Snowshoe freeride is going to be the next big thing.
