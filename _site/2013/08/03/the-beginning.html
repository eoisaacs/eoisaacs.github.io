<div class="post">
<p>In a few short weeks I will be traveling to Michigan Technological University for college. It&#39;s hard to think about moving 2000 miles away from home. I&#39;ve lived and gone to school near the same small town for close to 13 years with many of the same friends. As sad as it is to be leaving this, I&#39;m very excited for the opportunity to meet lots of different people and branch out my interests. There is a bit of a cultural difference between Oregon and the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of Michigan, but I like what I&#39;ve experienced on family vacations and my visit over spring break.</p>

<p><em>Houghton gets a little more snow than I&#39;m used to...</em></p>

<p>At Michigan Tech, I&#39;ll be starting out in General Engineering (basically undecided.) I don&#39;t have a clear idea of which branch I want to move into. Hopefully that will come with time. Academics will certainly be my focus and take up most of my time while I&#39;m there. 8am Calc 2 class here I come...</p>

<p>If I have time, there will be plenty of other activities to keep me busy. This may be a little bit ambitious, but I plan to participate in intramural sports, competitive mountain biking, running, potentially the student radio station, and have a social life. Something will probably have to go. I hope it isn&#39;t this blog.</p>

<p>I will be very busy before I leave, so this may very well be the only post for a while. I will be helping out at my high school XC coach&#39;s running camp and then going on a family camping trip. This means I have to start packing...</p>

<p>I have every intention of keeping this updated approximately weekly. How that will work out, I have no idea. I want to start recording my experiences regularly as well as working on my writing, and this seemed like a  good way to do it. We&#39;ll hope for the best.</p>
