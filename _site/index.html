      	<p>After many bittersweet goodbyes to friends and favorite places, I&#39;m finally on my way to Michigan. My friends, Bury the Moon, wrote a great song about this moment. They probably don&#39;t appreciate me posting this old, impromptu recording but that&#39;s really too bad for them since they have yet to release a newer one.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a little nervous but mostly excited to explore and meet new people. I will be very busy for the next few weeks so I&#39;m not sure when my next post will be. It may be brief.</p>

      	<p>Last week I helped out with the 27th (mostly) annual Timberhill Harriers running camp. I loved my two years as a camper and was more than happy to come back and join in on the fun. The camp started with an interesting new twist—most of the runners dropped off their bags and ran to camp via a 9 mile route through McDonald Forest. On a later long run we encountered an uncooperative skunk and a couple of elk. Unfortunately I did not bring my camera for the week.  </p>

<p>As always, it was a great experience with a beautiful setting, good friends, games, excellent food, and—of course—lots of running. I managed to put in 60 miles in five days after a pretty lazy summer. It made me wish I was doing Cross Country this year at Michigan Tech. I tend to forget how much I love running.  </p>

<p>The day after running camp ended, I left for Waldo Lake with my family for a short vacation. We carried all of our gear in canoes and camped around the shoreline at undeveloped sites.</p>

<p>It was incredibly relaxing to be away from civilization for a while. The only disruptions were the occasional distant train and jet contrails. Sometimes being out in the woods makes me wish we lived in simpler times.</p>

<p>The weather was spectacular and the mosquitoes fewer than feared. In addition to canoeing, we ran/hiked short section of the Shoreline Trail and crossed the headwaters of the North Fork of the Willamette River. Someday I will have to come back and run or mountain bike all 22 miles of beautiful singletrack encircling the lake.</p>

      	<p>In a few short weeks I will be traveling to Michigan Technological University for college. It&#39;s hard to think about moving 2000 miles away from home. I&#39;ve lived and gone to school near the same small town for close to 13 years with many of the same friends. As sad as it is to be leaving this, I&#39;m very excited for the opportunity to meet lots of different people and branch out my interests. There is a bit of a cultural difference between Oregon and the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of Michigan, but I like what I&#39;ve experienced on family vacations and my visit over spring break.</p>

<p>At Michigan Tech, I&#39;ll be starting out in General Engineering (basically undecided.) I don&#39;t have a clear idea of which branch I want to move into. Hopefully that will come with time. Academics will certainly be my focus and take up most of my time while I&#39;m there. 8am Calc 2 class here I come...  </p>

<p>If I have time, there will be plenty of other activities to keep me busy. This may be a little bit ambitious, but I plan to participate in intramural sports, competitive mountain biking, running, potentially the student radio station, and have a social life. Something will probably have to go. I hope it isn&#39;t this blog.  </p>

<p>I will be very busy before I leave, so this may very well be the only post for a while. I will be helping out at my high school XC coach&#39;s running camp and then going on a family camping trip. This means I have to start packing...  </p>

<p>I have every intention of keeping this updated approximately weekly. How that will work out, I have no idea. I want to start recording my experiences regularly as well as working on my writing, and this seemed like a  good way to do it. We&#39;ll hope for the best.  </p>
