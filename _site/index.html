<p>After a late-night video planning session, some guys from the cycling club invited me to go snowshoeing in Copper Harbor the next day. We took advantage of our free first time rentals from the outdoor adventure program. Quite a few poeple were waiting for snowshoes when we got there.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-22-img2.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing through deep powder"></p>

<p>After the drive to Copper Harbor, we climbed up Brockway Mountain and followed the Overflow downhill mountain bike trail back down. It was pretty different seeing the trail on foot in the winter compared to riding it in the summer.</p>

<p>The snow was practically untouched. We managed to stay on top most of the time, but there were spots where it was easy to sink in to the waist. We saw some faint downhill ski tracks, but no other signs of people.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-22-img3.jpg" alt="Climbing trees and then jumping out of them"></p>

<p>Like with any good adventure, tree climbing was in order. Snowshoing can be as exciting as you make it. I think extreme snowshoing could definitely take off.</p>

      	<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-14-img1.jpg" alt="ROTC dinosaur statues underway"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/history/" target= "_blank">Winter Carnival</a> is legendary at Michigan Tech. Classes are cancelled on Thursday and Friday, and that combined with the all-nighter on Wednesday night and the snow statue contest makes for a crazy four-day weekend.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-14-img2.jpg" alt="Winter carnival activity on College Ave."></p>

<p>Leading up to the all-nighter, I heard a lot of wild stories and rumors of drunken masses and hospitalizations. I had low expectations, but these tales turned out to be pretty accurate. The night started off pretty tame, with mostly statue workers and school employees on campus, but as it got later, campus slowly became saturated with students of varying levels of inebriation.</p>

<p>I spent the early part of the night drifting around between groups of people I recognized and looking at the statue work. Once it got late, it was time to take advantage of the $5 all-night unlimited pancakes being served in Fisher Hall. Once it started to get a little crazier we decided to head back to the dorms and settle in for what was left of the night.</p>

<p>There were a few incidents, but fortunately, the student body as a whole was very friendly and respectful. Campus safety was everywhere, but seemed pretty reasonable and accepting of the situation.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-14-img3.jpg" alt="Caterpillar statue in front of house on College Ave"></p>

<p>Winter Carnival doesn&#39;t end after the all-nighter is over, but there is a lull while everyone recovers from the night. Over the weekend, campus is ruled by local and foriegn families alike admiring the statues, getting dogsled rides, and watching the constant broomball games.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great time.</p>

      	<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img1.jpg" alt="Rollers in the new MTB flow trail at the Michigan Tech Trails"></p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons I was intitially drawn to Michigan Tech was the good reputation of the trail system on campus and others in the surrounding area. They absolutely did not disappoint. I spent as much time as I could out riding, mostly after class and on the weekends. The strong local support for trails and maintenance really shows in the quality of the riding and number of users on the trails.</p>

<p>Michigan Tech has done a lot to improve the trails as well, including the addition of a new flow trail this summer. It&#39;s the first flow trail I&#39;ve experienced, and it&#39;s a huge amount of fun. It&#39;s built so that beginning riders can ride the trail with no mandatory jumps, but there are gaps as large as 20-25 feet for the brave and experienced.</p>

<p>The Michigan Tech trails as a whole are a blast. I was able to improve my riding a lot with the huge variety of trails and features. Considering the relatively small amount of land that it takes up, it is an amazing place to have a few minutes from the dorms by bike, with many levels of trails, dirt jumps, and a dual slalom course.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img2.jpg" alt="Dual slalom MTB racers head-to-head at the Michigan Tech Trails"></p>

<p>Collegiate mountain bike racing includes categories for cross country, short track xc, downhill, and dual slalom. I competed in a short track race, but most of the pictures I took were of the regional dual slalom competition. Dual slalom is a fun event to watch, with the excitement of jumps and berms combined with head-to-head racing. I want to compete in this next year after I have a chance to get some practice in. The course is only about 200 yards long, but packed with features.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img6.jpg" alt="My trusty Kona Unit-29 singlespeed MTB at the Tech Trails"></p>

<p>I bought a new bike during the first week of school. It&#39;s my first 29er and the only singlespeed mountain bike I&#39;ve ever owned. It turned out to be a huge amount of fun, although for racing it wasn&#39;t ideal. I rode it hard and in all kinds of trails with very few issues. Having no suspension really forces you to choose good lines on technical trails and use your body to absorb bumps.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img7.jpg" alt="Entering the underground segment of the MTB trails at the Greenland Adventure Mine"></p>

<p>One of the most fun cycling club events I made it to was a guided ride of the trails of the Greenland Adventure Mine, where the Miner&#39;s Revenge xc and downhill races happen every year. The trails blew my expectations out of the water with how fun, technical, and spectacular they are. The section going through an old mine shaft was cool, but the trail system as a whole is what makes it. It&#39;s one of the best riding spots I&#39;ve ever been to.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img8.jpg" alt="The wooden gap feature on the new Overflow downhill MTB trail at Copper Harbor"></p>

<p>I was very happy to make it up to the Copper Harbor trails on several weekends with the cycling club. After all I&#39;d heard about them, it was amazing to actually be there and explore the place. The riding is awesome and definitely lives up to the hype. I can&#39;t wait for next season.</p>

<p>Overflow, the new downhill trail built this summer is insane. I hope next year I&#39;ll be closer to being able to ride all of it. The wooden gap over another trail in the above picture is beautifully constructed and terrifying. I want to do it someday but not until I feel a little bit more comfortable with the idea.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img9.jpg" alt="The insane rock face dubbed &quot;Man pants&quot; on the new Overflow downhill MTB trail at Copper Harbor"></p>

<p>One of the most spectacular features of the Overflow trail is a rock face known as &quot;Man Pants&quot; shown above. It is truly intimidating in person. I would like to try it next year, but we&#39;ll see when the time comes.</p>

<p>Copper Harbor and all of the other trails systems in the area makes this a mountain biking heaven in the warm months. It&#39;s worth a trip for any mountain biker and I absolutely love it.</p>

      	<p>After many bittersweet goodbyes to friends and favorite places, I&#39;m finally on my way to Michigan. My friends, Bury the Moon, wrote a great song about this moment. They probably don&#39;t appreciate me posting this old, impromptu recording but that&#39;s really too bad for them since they have yet to release a newer one.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a little nervous but mostly excited to explore and meet new people. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll keep busy for the next few weeks.</p>

      	<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-08-22-img1.jpg" alt="Canoe beached on volcanic gravel at Waldo Lake"></p>

<p>Last week I helped out with the 27th (mostly) annual Timberhill Harriers running camp. I loved my two years as a camper and was more than happy to come back and join in on the fun. The camp started with an interesting new twist—most of the runners dropped off their bags and ran to camp via a 9 mile route through McDonald Forest. On a later long run we encountered an uncooperative skunk and a couple of elk. Unfortunately I did not bring my camera for the week.  </p>

<p>As always, it was a great experience with a beautiful setting, good friends, games, excellent food, and—of course—lots of running. I managed to put in 60 miles in five days after a pretty lazy summer. It made me wish I was doing Cross Country this year at Michigan Tech. I tend to forget how much I love running.  </p>

<p>The day after running camp ended, I left for Waldo Lake with my family for a short vacation. We carried all of our gear in canoes and camped around the shoreline at undeveloped sites.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-08-22-img2.jpg" alt="Glassy water looking out accross the lake"></p>

<p>It was incredibly relaxing to be away from civilization for a while. The only disruptions were the occasional distant train and jet contrails. Sometimes being out in the woods makes me wish we lived in simpler times.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-08-22-img3.jpg" alt="Canoeing by moonlight"></p>

<p>The weather was spectacular and the mosquitoes fewer than feared. In addition to canoeing, we ran/hiked short section of the Shoreline Trail and crossed the headwaters of the North Fork of the Willamette River. Someday I will have to come back and run or mountain bike the spectacular 22-mile trail encircling the lake.</p>

      	<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-08-03-img1.jpg" alt="Houghton lift bridge in the Winter"></p>

<p>In a few weeks I will be traveling to Michigan Technological University for college. It&#39;s hard to think about moving 2000 miles away from home. I&#39;ve lived and gone to school near the same small town for close to 13 years with many of the same friends. As sad as it is to be leaving this, I&#39;m very excited for the opportunity to meet lots of different people and branch out my interests. There is a bit of a cultural difference between Oregon and the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of Michigan, but I like what I&#39;ve experienced on family vacations and my visit over spring break.</p>

<p>At Michigan Tech, I&#39;ll be starting out in General Engineering (basically undecided.) I don&#39;t have a clear idea of which branch I want to move into. Hopefully that will come with time. Academics will certainly be my focus and take up most of my time while I&#39;m there. 8am Calc 2 class here I come.</p>

<p>If I have time, there will be plenty of other activities to keep me busy. This may be a little bit ambitious, but I plan to participate in intramural sports, competitive mountain biking, running, potentially the student radio station, and have a social life. Something will probably have to go.</p>

<p>I will be very busy before I leave, so this may very well be the only post for a while. I will be helping out at my high school XC coach&#39;s running camp and then going on a family camping trip. This means I have to start packing...</p>

<p>I have every intention of keeping this updated approximately weekly. How that will work out, I have no idea. I want to start recording my experiences regularly as well as working on my writing, and this seemed like a good way to do it.</p>
