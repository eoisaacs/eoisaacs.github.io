<p>My friend Anthony was nice enough to invite me to stay at his place in Sheboygan, Wisconsin over spring break. It was a much-needed change of pace after a couple of months of engineering classes and exams and the harsh winter in Houghton. The weather was incredible during my stay, with temperatures getting above 60F on Monday and getting close to that again on Friday.</p>

<p>Sheboygan is a surprisingly nice town to spend time in (I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m surprised, I just didn&#39;t expect a whole lot), with a nice waterfront and a decent downtown area. We kept pretty busy, biking as much as possible as well as cooking whatever we felt like and meeting up with Anthony&#39;s friends in town.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed hanging out with his dogs as well. It seemed to help a little with how much I miss mine at home.</p>

<h3>Bike Shenanigans</h3>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-03-12-img2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I bought a dirtjumper from a guy on craigslist on the Monday of break (because I sure needed another mountain bike!). We took advantage of the weather and were able to get out riding every day from then on. We spend a lot of time just messing around in the streets by Anthony&#39;s house, but also made a few trips for more excitement and variety. </p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-03-12-img3.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We spent a day acting like punks finding fun things to ride downtown, including stairs, barriers, walls, curbs, and parking lot islands. We even got kicked out of a motel parking lot, which was a first for me. It a remarkably pleasant experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-03-12-img4.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>During two of the colder days, we made the drive to Ray&#39;s Indoor MTB park in Milwaukee. It&#39;s a very unique bike park that is entirely contained within an old Menard&#39;s building. The amount of terrain and riding features crammed inside is incredible. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I was pretty comfortable after visiting twice previously this year with the MTU cycling club.</p>

<p>Ray&#39;s has a fast and fun pumptrack and a foam pit along with all of their standard technical and jump trails. It&#39;s a really good place to practice technique try out tricks that you wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with otherwise, or just mess around.</p>

<h3>Paradigm Coffee &amp; Music</h3>

<p>Sheboygan is home to a <a href="http://paradigmvenue.com/" target= "_blank">Paradigm Coffee &amp; Music</a>, a really awesome coffee shop that is one of Anthony&#39;s favorite hangouts. It has a vibrant but laid-back atmosphere, with high vaulted ceilings and bikes hanging from pillars everywhere. The furniture mostly consists of comfy old couches and low tables, and local artist&#39;s displays decorate most of the walls.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a stage and sound system set up for live music performances. They offer a good variety of food and drinks including reportedly excellent coffee from the Milwaukee roaster <a href="http://colectivocoffee.com/" target= "_blank">Collectivo</a>. I highly recommend Paradigm&#39;s Tangerine Ginger Tea and Zeus Sandwich.</p>

<h3>Rebike</h3>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-03-12-img11.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The basement of Paradigm is home to <a href="http://www.nomosheboygancounty.com/programs/rebike" target= "_blank">Rebike</a>, Sheboygan&#39;s bicycle rehabilitation program. Bikes are donated by community members, and then parted out or restored by volunteers during weekly Wednesday night sessions. </p>

<p>Everyone I met who was involved was very passionate about bikes and loved working there. There are similar programs in cities all around the world that have sprung up to help ensure that bikes don&#39;t go to waste and the people have access to affordable, healthy, and environmentally friendly transportation.</p>

<p>Thanks to Anthony&#39;s parents for being such gracious hosts over the break, and for putting up with all of our bikes scattered around their house.</p>

      	<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-22-img1.jpg" alt="Overflow downhill mountain bike trail wooden feature in winter"></p>

<p>After a late-night video planning session, some guys from the cycling club invited me to go snowshoeing in Copper Harbor the next day. We took advantage of our free first time rentals from the outdoor adventure program. Quite a few poeple were waiting for snowshoes when we got there.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-22-img2.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing through deep powder"></p>

<p>After the drive to Copper Harbor, we climbed up Brockway Mountain and followed the Overflow downhill mountain bike trail back down. It was pretty different seeing the trail on foot in the winter compared to riding it in the summer.</p>

<p>The snow was practically untouched. We managed to stay on top most of the time, but there were spots where it was easy to sink in to the waist. We saw some faint downhill ski tracks, but no other signs of people.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-22-img3.jpg" alt="Climbing trees and then jumping out of them"></p>

<p>Like with any good adventure, tree climbing was in order. Snowshoing can be as exciting as you make it. I think extreme snowshoing could definitely take off.</p>

      	<p class="meta">February 14, 2014 | <a href="/2014/02/14/winter-carnival-2014/#disqus_thread"></a></p>
      	<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-14-img1.jpg" alt="ROTC dinosaur statues underway"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/history/" target= "_blank">Winter Carnival</a> is legendary at Michigan Tech. Classes are cancelled on Thursday and Friday, and that combined with the all-nighter on Wednesday night and the snow statue contest makes for a crazy four-day weekend.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-14-img2.jpg" alt="Winter carnival activity on College Ave."></p>

<p>Leading up to the all-nighter, I heard a lot of wild stories and rumors of drunken masses and hospitalizations. I had low expectations, but these tales turned out to be pretty accurate. The night started off pretty tame, with mostly statue workers and school employees on campus, but as it got later, campus slowly became saturated with students of varying levels of inebriation.</p>

<p>I spent the early part of the night drifting around between groups of people I recognized and looking at the statue work. Once it got late, it was time to take advantage of the $5 all-night unlimited pancakes being served in Fisher Hall. Once it started to get a little crazier we decided to head back to the dorms and settle in for what was left of the night.</p>

<p>There were a few incidents, but fortunately, the student body as a whole was very friendly and respectful. Campus safety was everywhere, but seemed pretty reasonable and accepting of the situation.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2014-02-14-img3.jpg" alt="Caterpillar statue in front of house on College Ave"></p>

<p>Winter Carnival doesn&#39;t end after the all-nighter is over, but there is a lull while everyone recovers from the night. Over the weekend, campus is ruled by local and foriegn families alike admiring the statues, getting dogsled rides, and watching the constant broomball games.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great time.</p>

      	<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img1.jpg" alt="Rollers in the new MTB flow trail at the Michigan Tech Trails"></p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons I was intitially drawn to Michigan Tech was the good reputation of the trail system on campus and others in the surrounding area. They absolutely did not disappoint. I spent as much time as I could out riding, mostly after class and on the weekends. The strong local support for trails and maintenance really shows in the quality of the riding and number of users on the trails.</p>

<p>Michigan Tech has done a lot to improve the trails as well, including the addition of a new flow trail this summer. It&#39;s the first flow trail I&#39;ve experienced, and it&#39;s a huge amount of fun. It&#39;s built so that beginning riders can ride the trail with no mandatory jumps, but there are gaps as large as 20-25 feet for the brave and experienced.</p>

<p>The Michigan Tech Trails as a whole are a blast. I was able to improve my riding a lot with the huge variety of trails and features. Considering the relatively small amount of land that it takes up, it is an amazing place to have a few minutes from the dorms by bike, with many levels of trails, dirt jumps, and a dual slalom course.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img2.jpg" alt="Dual slalom MTB racers head-to-head at the Michigan Tech Trails"></p>

<p>Collegiate mountain bike racing includes categories for cross country, short track xc, downhill, and dual slalom. I competed in a short track race, but most of the pictures I took were of the regional dual slalom competition. Dual slalom is a fun event to watch, with the excitement of jumps and berms combined with head-to-head racing. I want to compete in this next year after I have a chance to get some practice in. The course is only about 200 yards long, but packed with features.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img6.jpg" alt="My trusty Kona Unit-29 singlespeed MTB at the Tech Trails"></p>

<p>I bought a new bike during the first week of school. It&#39;s my first 29er and the only singlespeed mountain bike I&#39;ve ever owned. It turned out to be a huge amount of fun, although for racing it wasn&#39;t ideal. I rode it hard and in all kinds of trails with very few issues. Having no suspension really forces you to choose good lines on technical trails and use your body to absorb bumps.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img7.jpg" alt="Entering the underground segment of the MTB trails at the Greenland Adventure Mine"></p>

<p>One of the most fun cycling club events I made it to was a guided ride of the trails of the Greenland Adventure Mine, where the Miner&#39;s Revenge xc and downhill races happen every year. The trails blew my expectations out of the water with how fun, technical, and spectacular they are. The section going through an old mine shaft was cool, but the trail system as a whole is what makes it. It&#39;s one of the best riding spots I&#39;ve ever been to.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img8.jpg" alt="The wooden gap feature on the new Overflow downhill MTB trail at Copper Harbor"></p>

<p>I was very happy to make it up to the Copper Harbor trails on several weekends with the cycling club. After all I&#39;d heard about them, it was amazing to actually be there and explore the place. The riding is awesome and definitely lives up to the hype. I can&#39;t wait for next season.</p>

<p>Overflow, the new downhill trail built this summer is insane. I hope next year I&#39;ll be closer to being able to ride all of it. The wooden gap over another trail in the above picture is beautifully constructed and terrifying. I want to do it someday but not until I feel a little bit more comfortable with the idea.</p>

<p><img src="http://eoisaacs.github.io/images/2013-11-05-img9.jpg" alt="The insane rock face dubbed &quot;Man pants&quot; on the new Overflow downhill MTB trail at Copper Harbor"></p>

<p>One of the most spectacular features of the Overflow trail is a rock face known as &quot;Man Pants&quot; shown above. It is truly intimidating in person. I would like to try it next year, but we&#39;ll see when the time comes.</p>

<p>Copper Harbor and all of the other trails systems in the area makes this a mountain biking heaven in the warm months. It&#39;s worth a trip for any mountain biker and I absolutely love it.</p>

      	<p>After many bittersweet goodbyes to friends and favorite places, I&#39;m finally on my way to Michigan. My friends, Bury the Moon, wrote a great song about this moment. They probably don&#39;t appreciate me posting this old, impromptu recording but that&#39;s really too bad for them since they have yet to release a newer one.  </p>
